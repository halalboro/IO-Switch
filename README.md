# IO-Switch
 - Designed a 4x4 Streaming I/O Switch based on a simplified version of the AXI protocol to solve a FPGA Design Problem Statement.
 - The I/O switch implements register-based control and data interfaces that follow the AXI protocol loosely.
 - The testbench was written in C++ to simulate the I/O switch design on the Verilator simulation tool and obtain the output in the form of a waveform (.vcd).
 - Packaged everything into a reproducible form using Docker Containers.
